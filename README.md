### PR Review Process ###
1. Branch off from `develop` branch in your IDE with `git checkout -b branchName`
    - All branches should start with `feature/`.
    - You can pull someone else's branch if they've pushed it by checking out to their branch name: `git checkout theirBranchName`.
2. Make your changes, `git add`, `git commit`, then `git push origin branchName`
    - If you forget to make a new branch, you can always do `git stash` then `git stash pop` after you create your branch.
4. Create your pull request in the Pull Requests tab. Assign yourself as the assignee, and add the whole team as reviewers.
    - All PRs need at least 3 approvers to merge.

- Together, we will merge the develop branch into main. Our web application will deploy the main branch.
